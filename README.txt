1_Scale-free network：
        adjacency_matrix_loop.mat is the LIF hierarchical network based on the scale-free network by assigning the total number of individuals $n=260$, the initial number of individuals $m_0= 10$, and the number of connected edges $m = 10$.
        A_degree.mat is the degree matrix and index.mat is the corresponding index matrix.
        FreeScale1.m is the code of the scale-free network.

2_Dolphin social network：
        Dolphin__adjacency_matrix.mat is the LIF hierarchical network based on the real Dolphin social network with self-loops.
        The degree matrix and the corresponding index matrix can obtain by Dolphin__adjacency_matrix.mat.
